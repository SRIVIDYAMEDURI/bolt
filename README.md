<h2>RF CMS</h2>

<p>An open source Ruby on Rails content management system for Rails 3.</p>

<p>More information at http://rfcms.railsfactory.com</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>RF_cms is great for sites where the client needs to be able to update their website themselves without being bombarded with anything too complicated.</p>

<p>Unlike other content managers, RF_cms is truly aimed at the end user making it easy for them to pick up and make changes themselves.</p>

<h2>For developers</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Easily customise the look to suit the business.</li>
  <li>Extend with custom extensions to do anything RF_cms doesn't do out of the box.</li>
  <li>Sticks to "the Rails way" as much as possible; we don't force you to learn new templating languages.</li>
  <li>Uses jQuery for fast and concise Javascript.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Steps to follow</h2>
<ul>
<li>bundle exec rails g bolt:install</li>
<li>bundle exec rake db:create</li>
<li>bundle exec rake db:migrate</li>
<li>bundle exec rake bolt:create_admin email="email address"</li>
</ul>
